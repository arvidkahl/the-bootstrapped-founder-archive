The Emotional Journey of a Bootstrapped Founder is a series of articles written by FeedbackPanda founder and founder of the FeedbackP Panda podcast. In this series, I talk about how certain situations and incidents can evoke strong emotions and how to deal with them. I will explain how I reflected and reframed those thoughts and feelings, then suggest actions for immediate and long-term improvements.
