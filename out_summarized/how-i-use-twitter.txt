Twitter is a great way to build an audience, build relationships, and find opportunities. I started using Twitter regularly to engage with other founders and talk about my work in October 2019, just shortly after Danielle and I sold our SaaS FeedbackPanda. Back in June 2020, just before I released my book, I had 4000 followers. I have since created a Twitter audience-building course called Find your Following.
