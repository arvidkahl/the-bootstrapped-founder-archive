When I launched my Twitter course Find your Following earlier this week, I realized that my launch Tweet had a typo. I chose to embrace this imperfection and roll with it. Within the first 24 hours, the course sold almost $5000â€™s worth. Nobody talked about the typo. Everyone enjoyed my marketing video.
