As someone who often hands out advice to clients and mentees, I see it being handled in many ways. The fruitless way of taking in advice is to apply it verbatim. The flipside of this behavior is to completely ignore advice without giving it a chance. If you donâ€™t understand what happened before, during and after an event, just following the steps of a solution will not produce meaningful results.
