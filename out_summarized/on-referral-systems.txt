Referrals are not a cheap marketing trick. When done right, they can be a great way to grow your business and provide value to new and old customers alike. At FeedbackPanda, we added a referral system when we raised our prices by 50% on January 1st, 2019. The referral system was supposed to both amplify existing word-of-mouth marketing as well as give our customers a means to offset the increased price of their subscriptions.
