The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is your first contact with your customers. It has two main functions: to allow your early adopters to gauge the value of your service and to enable you to charge them money to gauge their sincerity. To have your MVP leave a great first impression, you will need to scope it sufficiently and time it well.
