When we’re praised or receive kindness, we show both physical and psychological reactions. Leading with kindness creates strong and enjoyable relationships. Being kind and grateful is also a wonderful thing to do within your community. It’s a catalyst for more kindness, both towards you and towards everyone else in the community.
