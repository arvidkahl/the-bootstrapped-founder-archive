A few months ago, I ran an NFT experiment that failed horribly. I put a lot of effort into creating and minting a few pieces of visual art that I thought would resonate with my audience, and then the whole thing fizzled out. I wanted to see if there was a chance for a self-published writer like me to mint visual NFTs, allowing my readers to support me.
