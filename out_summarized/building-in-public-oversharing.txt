Oversharing is the act of sharing either too much or the wrong content. You’re oversharing whenever you share something that isn’t creating mutual benefit for you and your audience. There are three distinct kinds of oversharing: the Saturated Feed, the Self-Sabotage Share and the Audience-Message Disconnect.
