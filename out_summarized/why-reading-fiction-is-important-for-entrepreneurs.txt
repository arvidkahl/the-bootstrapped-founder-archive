Fiction is a great way to learn about your customers and the people you want to serve and empower. The more fiction you read, the more you will learn what makes a narrative interesting. Every good story has a heroâ€™s journey at its core, and the better a storyteller the author is. The social dynamics of those groups will differ wildly from what you know.
