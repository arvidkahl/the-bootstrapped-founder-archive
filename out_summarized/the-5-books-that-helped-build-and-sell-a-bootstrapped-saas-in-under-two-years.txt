Tim Ferriss' The 4-Hour Workweek is a guide to a new life for bootstrapped entrepreneurs. The book is aimed at liberating the reader from the chains of gainful employment and all the limitations that come with a regular full-time office job. If you follow the steps and advice in the book, you will end up with a fully automated business that you can work on for a few hours a week.
