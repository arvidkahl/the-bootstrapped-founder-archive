Danielle was teaching English as a Second Language online to Chinese children. She was working 12-hour days teaching while I was working as a Software Engineer for a German company in the IoT space. She would work for two extra hours to write Student Feedback for the parents of the kids she had taught that day. Two years later, we sold the bootstrapped company that grew out of that tool to SureSwift Capital.
