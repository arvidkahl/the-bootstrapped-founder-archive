Two years ago, Danielle and I sold our productivity SaaS FeedbackPanda. After selling the business, Danielle decided to start a blog and a podcast. She wanted to give back and allow others to benefit from what she had come to learn. She also wanted to externalize the motivation for being consistent to an audience of eager readers.
