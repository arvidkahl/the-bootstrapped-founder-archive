A SaaS business has two major components: its technical product and the operating system that allows you to sell that product consistently. Whatever you build, make it abstract enough to be swiftly replaced. Make it easy to stop working with a tax advisor and shift your data to another system. You donâ€™t want to build something around a particular service only to see them go out of business.
