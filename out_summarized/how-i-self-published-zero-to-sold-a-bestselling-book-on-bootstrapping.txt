In 2018, I was so fully immersed in working on FeedbackPanda, a teacher productivity SaaS that I co-founded with my partner Danielle, that I didnâ€™t have much time or energy to write. After a few months of due diligence and transitioning the business over to the new owners, I finally had all the time I ever wanted. So I threw myself right into my next project: documenting what we did and sharing what we had learned. I decided to commit to publishing one article every week for at least two years.
