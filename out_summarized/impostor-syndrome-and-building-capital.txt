Every creator, everyone speaking in public, knows this feeling. It is a part of our brainâ€™s wiring to try to protect us from the unknown dangers that we might attract when we put ourselves out there. Embrace the fear, invite it in, hear it out, and then ignore it. People will follow you because of your vulnerability, not despite it.
