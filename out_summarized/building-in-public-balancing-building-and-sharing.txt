Building and sharing are not distinct but symbiotic, as they establish a feedback cycle. While you teach something, others will learn and engage with you. From that, you will learn more about them and their needs, triggering opportunities to build. The balance between doing and talking is something unique to your journey. Sometimes, you spend days, maybe weeks building, and other times, you share and interact.
