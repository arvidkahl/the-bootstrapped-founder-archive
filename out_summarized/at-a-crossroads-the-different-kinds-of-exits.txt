Companies get acquired for a few reasons. Depending on why someone wants to buy your company, the deal and the whole process of selling the company may be radically different. Usually, that money arrives in two parts: one directly when you hand over the company, and another when the transition is completed. Be prepared to receive different offers from different parties.
