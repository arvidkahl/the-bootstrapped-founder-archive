# The Bootstrapped Founder Archive

This repository contains the code to summarize all the archive in The Bootstrapped Founder blog.

Some are full articles and some are interviews so those won't have a valid summary.

This project has no intention to be monetized and claims no rights to the blog itself. Every thing is owned by Arvid Kahl (https://twitter.com/arvidkahl).

If you want to run the code just install the requirements and get an API key from HuggingFace.

- /out directory has raw articles
- /out_summarized has the AI summary version of every article
- summary.md has the stiched version of all the files


Hope you enjoy reading it as I have. Cheers!
