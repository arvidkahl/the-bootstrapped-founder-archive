When it comes to customer relationships, momentum is on your side: it is much easier to retain a customer than it is to find a new one. Once the initial inertia is surpassed, the effort that needs to be put into keeping a customer is significantly lower than acquiring and onboarding another customer. And a churned customer is a double loss: not only do you have to find a new customer to replace them. To grow, you will need to find two new customers. That‚Äôs why customer retention is of utmost importance to grow a business reliably.
This focus on retaining a customer at all costs is somewhat new. Before the subscription economy, a repeat customer was a nice-to-have, but most of the time, the relationship with the customer was over after the first transaction. Processes were optimized to get the customer through the order process and stop them from abandoning their cart. But once they ordered, it was over.
The membership economy is very different. Customer retention is more important than getting new customers, as churn is the silent killer. Retention can be measured in renewal or cancellation rates, and keeping it as close to 100% as possible will decide if your business is sustainable or not.
Luckily, there are several proven strategies to increase retention, and they all center around your relationship with your customers.
Value Nurturing
Value nurturing strategies increase the customer‚Äôs perceived value of your product, making the cancellation feel like a more significant loss. Showing your customers how much they benefit from your product will make them stick around longer.
Your goal is to over and over again confirm your customers‚Äô belief that choosing your service was a smart choice. Not only does it have to feel right, but it should also clearly be a good economic decision, both on their first day and right now.
In an ideal world, customers would continuously notice what a fantastic product you provide them with. They would flood your customer service channels with thank you messages, and they would write long blog posts about how everyone should be a customer of your business, forever. Sadly, life gets in the way, and other things are much more important to your customers.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs up to you to show them what they get. Show them their progress, how much they have improved ever since they used your service. Show them how well they do compared to other users, how much impact your service has in their lives. In short: make the value they receive visible to them inside your product and in your communication.
It‚Äôs not only limited to this, though. The goal is to retain a customer, and showing them what they get is just one way of keeping them around. You want your product to be something they depend on. When times are tough, you want your service to be the last one to be canceled. This is best accomplished by creating voluntary dependency: offer something that your customers want to depend on. Provide so much value compared to the alternatives that they willingly take the risks inherent in every choice of using an external product.
A word about value: we are not just talking about your revenue here. For your customers to stick around, your business needs to provide them with benefits and advantages every single time they use it. Your customer lifetime value is inextricably linked to the perceived value of your customers.¬†
Here‚Äôs the trick to customer success: increasing their revenue will increase yours. Make them successful, help them grow the lifetime value of their customers, and their LTV will expand as well.
Expectation Management
Managing expectations is a significant factor too. Being able to occasionally over-deliver will delight your customers as it is an unexpected bonus. I‚Äôm not saying you should consistently undersell your product. But surprising a customer with something good they didn‚Äôt expect is a rare occurrence in the business world. Those who succeed at that will be remembered.
Customers will tell a few people about a positive experience, but they will tell a few dozen about a negative one. Keeping customers above the baseline will reduce the chance of them ranting to their peers, who may often be potential customers.
Every impression counts. At any touchpoint, you can synchronize expectations. Find out what your customers are concerned with and adjust your priorities when expectations change. From your customer‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs a magical thing to see a feature suggestion become an actual feature.¬†
The level of trust in the brand and the decisions you make are incredibly important for renewal. By aligning what your customers expect you to do with your actions, trust grows, and value generation will happen along with the expectations of your customers.
Those expectations change over time. In the beginning, customers often have to find their footing, and they expect ease of use and being able to integrate your product into their workflow. After a few years, focus shifts to perceived value, as your service has become a regular part of your customers‚Äô work routine. Unless they‚Äôre really needed, customers will ask less and less for new features, and they will shift their focus onto existing parts of your offer and how the current set of features can be improved even more.
Throughout a customer‚Äôs lifetime, get a feel for the acceptance of and desire for self-service in your customer base. In the beginning, you can respond to every support query yourself. When you scale, more of your support will shift towards more asynchronous and self-help solutions. It‚Äôs important to take your customers with you on that journey. The early adopter that you talked to every few days through your real-time chat will have to understand that your attention is more divided. Their expectations will need to change with your structural changes.
Find the At-Risk-of-Leaving Customers
In the best case, a customer stays with you for many years. They love your product, their very wishes come true every time, and they become catalysts for your marketing.¬†
This is, of course, utopian. Every single customer of yours has different problems and hardships, and what works for one may not work for the other. Inevitably, at some point, a few customers will think about canceling. If you want your retention to remain high, there are two things you can do:
Convince them to stay before leaving.¬†The hard part is to figure out who is about to leave. You can track people clicking the button that starts the cancellation process and trigger a customer service conversation. Tag this customer as someone who should receive a follow-up email asking what you can do for them. You can track other things than clear cancellation intent: do they stop using the product for a long time? Stay clear of acting too quickly, as this is often a result of vacation, maternal leave, or just other priorities. But it is worth measuring so that you have an indicator you can use to inform your communication strategy.
Convince them to come back after they leave.¬†This is your last chance to retain them as a customer. After someone cancels, give them a grace period of a few days or hours, but re-engage them. Depending on how shameless you want to be, ask them to return with a free month, or even extend them the offer of a lifetime discount for returning on a paid subscription. As long as it fits into your economic calculations, keeping a customer is worth more than losing them, even with reduced revenue.
There is a difference in what makes customers leave, and it is connected to how long they have been with you. Early customers are more likely to quit because of lower switching costs and less dependency on your service within their established workflows. They‚Äôre more jittery, so expect their cohorts to cancel more. Long-term customers quit for different reasons: either their perceived value decreases or the problem-solution-fit of your service is misaligned. Take your customer size and age into account when you craft your messaging for each cohort, and find something that works for each of them.
Actionable Retention
Here are a few things we did at FeedbackPanda to keep customer retention as high as possible.
Staying in touch with your customers will keep them engaged. Offer a weekly newsletter to expose them to things that happened in their industry will do two things: first, it will associate your business with a trusted source of information, and it will also show that you know what you‚Äôre talking about. Building trust and reputation goes a long way toward retaining a customer.
Tighten and focus your onboarding. A customer who ‚Äúgets it‚Äù quickly after signing up will stay with you longer and think of your business as a dependable service. If you can reduce the number of steps until your prospective customer reaches the ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù effect, go for it. There is nothing better than a customer telling their peers that your service is ‚Äúa no-brainer.‚Äù¬†
Do things that don‚Äôt scale. Send a postcard. Delight your customers with surprises on their birthdays. Send them a gift after they‚Äôve been with you for a year. Host a meetup in the city where most of them live. Surprise them in ways that other businesses can‚Äôt ‚Äî and wouldn‚Äôt. Not only will this make those customers stick around, but word will travel, and you will benefit from your customers sharing their delight and surprise with each other. When we had our first one hundred customers, we sent out postcards to all of them. A lot of customers shared photos of receiving those postcards in the mail, and consequently, a lot of prospects signed up for our service.
Ask your customers for testimonials. Use them on your marketing site, in app-stores, or any other platform where they can share it with their peers. This gives you reputation and your customer a feeling of being appreciated; after all, they are asked about their opinion. We often did this after intense customer service interactions where we solved a customer‚Äôs problem successfully. A happy customer gives great reviews.
In every interaction, focus on building a respectful relationship with your customer. It‚Äôs the one currency that is worth more than the money they pay you every month.
