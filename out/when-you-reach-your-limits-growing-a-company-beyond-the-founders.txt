If youâ€™re coming from a professional background in salaried positions, the chances are that youâ€™ve never hired anyone before. And even if you have, hiring someone for your own business will be a daunting task.
It certainly was for me. I thought that I could manage all that work by myself just fine, so why bother hiring. But I limited myself by doing things that kept me from doing more meaningful work. I was spreading myself too thin, trying to multitask when each task would have deserved my full attention.
Sure, itâ€™s great to help customers through live chat. But should I not have spent the time fixing the very issues they complained about? Could someone else not have a friendly conversation and show them a link to the article in the knowledge base where all the steps were laid out? Most importantly, did it really need to be me?
The Mistakes I Made When I Thought I Didnâ€™t Need to Hire
My first mistake was to think that it would only be reasonable to hire when there would be enough work for a full-time position. To this day, I donâ€™t know why I didnâ€™t think of hiring someone part-time, but to me, a job was a full-time endeavor. This resulted in a strange scenario: I never felt it would be enough work for a hire, because not only could I do it myself, but I would also fit other things into my workday. The fact that I worked 12 hours or more every day of the week seemed to not have registered in my entrepreneurial brain.
Hiring someone could have saved me countless hours of work every day, freeing my mind from focusing on the mundane parts of the business at all times. Sometimes, in between customer service chats, I would get a glimpse of what that life could be. I just shrugged it off, but I should have acted on that initial feeling and hired someone to help me.
My second mistake was to think that onboarding a new hire would be too much work. It turned out that waiting to onboard a new hire is even more work, as it just adds all the tasks you donâ€™t get to delegate on top of the onboarding efforts. I completely misjudged how effective other people can be at learning a new task. I also underestimated the impact of being well-prepared by having built a sellable business.
If youâ€™re using Standard Operating Procedures in your business, the effort of onboarding will be rather low, as you can just give the new employee access to the relevant processes and documentation. Provided that you created meaningful, exhaustive, and instructive documentation, your new hire can explore the scope of their job and prepare for what is to come.
How and Whom to Hire
You always hear that you should hire slowly. Thatâ€™s true; you donâ€™t want to waste resources when you could do it yourself or build automation to take care of it. But once you see that youâ€™re stuck doing work you donâ€™t enjoy that others could do for you, hire quickly.
Choosing what position to hire for will be a very subjective decision. After all, your preferences and tolerance for doing certain jobs are uniquely yours. Only you know when enough is enough.
In most SaaS businesses, customer service positions will be the first ones for which you may want to hire. While software can scale indefinitely, you canâ€™t. Once your customer base grows, you can automate as much as possible, but there will still be unforeseen problems at random points in time. Finding someone to triage these issues and sending only the most important ones through to you will free up significant space on your calendar and in your mind.
Marketing and sales positions can also be hired for quite early. For all three roles, you, as a founder, must instill the voice and tone of the messaging into your early employees. Until now, you have always been yourself, speaking to the customers the way you speak. Itâ€™s essential to keep this style consistent.
Hire someone for the work that annoys you most. Repeat until you enjoy all the work you do.
How to Find Your Perfect Hire
There are two places that I recommend checking out before you head over to the regular job portals and recruiting agencies: expert communities and within your customer base. Iâ€™ve found both to yield excellent results in multiple startups Iâ€™ve been with.
Expert communities work extremely well for finding developers, designers, and marketers. As a bootstrapped founder, you are at least partially a developer, designer, and marketer. During your entrepreneurial journey, you will have encountered the communities where other professionals hang out. You will likely even have asked a few questions or chatted with other founders. When you are looking into hiring someone, go into the communities that you found most inviting, and offer the job there first. Youâ€™ll pre-filter your applicants that way, and have a much higher chance of finding someone who will fit your culture.
Your customers can be a hunting ground for potential employees as well. Particularly for marketing and customer service positions, there are a lot of opportunities when searching for candidates among your customers. No one knows more about the struggles and needs of your customers than your customers themselves. That makes them ideal candidates to take over the jobs that involve talking to prospective or existing patrons of your business. They speak their language, and they know their pain even more than you. They are destined to build bridges and foster relationships with people they innately understand.
I had great success with both kinds of communities both within FeedbackPanda and at a previous startup. Hiring customer service experts from within our customer base was particularly effective in both cases. If you find a person who is looking for something new and is already aware of your company, all it takes is for them to have a background in the field. As people change jobs every few years, itâ€™s not uncommon to find a marketing expert who has become a teacher or a customer service professional who also is interested in local food logistics. You donâ€™t know what talent slumbers among your customers until you ask.
It will always be hard to convince people to join a small business. Youâ€™ll need to have a good pitch ready, as you will need to convey your vision of the business and the part that your new employee will play. Youâ€™ll need to make clear how they can grow professionally in their new position. This may be a hard thing to verbalize, particularly when youâ€™re looking for someone to take over tasks that you find tedious. But donâ€™t worry, people love all kinds of work. Thatâ€™s why we have accountants who actually enjoy their jobs. And after all, thatâ€™s what you want for your business: everyone should love all the work theyâ€™re doing. Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re hiring. Youâ€™re giving people who crave certain tasks a chance to do them for you, for your business, and ultimately for their own enjoyment and livelihood.
